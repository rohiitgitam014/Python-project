To predict the chances of winning a candidate
In this project, I used the Eda concept to predict the chance of winning a candidate. Eda stands for Exploratory Data Analysis under which we have Cross-industry standard procedure. Under cross-industry standard procedure, we have the following stages:
1. Business understanding
2. Data understanding
3. Data Preparation
4. Modelling
5. Evaluation
6. Deployment
In this project, I used 70 % training and 30 % testing datasets. I got my r2_score for evaluating my model as 71 %.
After evaluating my model, I learned which independent variable affects my target or dependent variable . For this project, I used total votes as my independent variable and the winner as my target or dependent variable. After getting my independent variable I used it to find the candidate who was the winner.In this project I used the Election dataset.
