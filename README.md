To predict the chances of winning a candidate
In this project, I utilized the concept of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to predict a candidate's chances of winning an election. EDA is guided by the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM), which involves the following stages:

Business Understanding
Data Understanding
Data Preparation
Modeling
Evaluation
Deployment
I split the dataset into 70% for training and 30% for testing. The modelâ€™s performance was measured using the Classification Report, which resulted in a value of 95% accuracy. This score indicates the model's ability to explain the variance in the dependent variable.

Through the evaluation process, I identified the key independent variable affecting the target variable. In this project, the total number of votes was used as the independent variable, while the election winner was the dependent variable. By analyzing this relationship, I was able to predict the winning candidate. The project was conducted using an election dataset.
